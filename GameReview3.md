## Game Review

# Details
 The game I decided to play was hitman the complete edition. 

# Summary
 The game takes place in different locations and has different set of objectives to complete as a assassin or in this a hitman. When it comes to stealth the main purpose is to kill your target any way possible with out getting caught doing it. What I see when playing the game is all the different and unique way to kill your target making the game not so repetitive and boring. You could also play around and explore if you have time waiting for your target. 




# Final Thoughts
 Would continue to play the game, yes cause they also have new releases and updates for the game it does have new stories that you could play.
