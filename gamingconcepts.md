## i feel the two most improntant skills to have when it comes to game testing is fisrt knowing how rthe coding works and what the code is made to produce. you also have to identify if the player will try to break the game by leaving the world and going outside of it.when it comes to the weapons the tester need to know if the weapon responds they way it should and loads up works and operate.

## the hardest thing about testing a game or software is figuring out what the problem is with the code and fixing especally if you doing a mutliplayer platform. when one person like in texas use a skill on a palyer say like in mississppi it should respnd the same or a bug could happen like it hits the player but on the other side it might of gazed the player.

## during the video i've learned about tester is that when it comes to testing sometimes tester would call other places or country and test the game through servers to seee if the work and respond well and no setbacks.
