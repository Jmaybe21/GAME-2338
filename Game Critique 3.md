## Game Critique

In this game critique i'd picked geomerty dash for mobile phones on andriod and ipones. geometry dash is a runner/music platfomer made by Robert Topala. whenever im bored or just want to keep my self entertain,this the game i usually play.

As i play through this games some fuctions of the game i sought out that could be tetsted more. the fisrt fuction that could be help tested is the touchscreen aspect of the game. when playing the game you have to tap the screen to move your object or more so have your object either jump,fly,float,etc. sometimes when a person taps the screen the gameplay deosnt respond most of the time. this could due to a glitch or lag of the serevrs. Another function of the game is customizing your cube or ship or other parts of your object. some customize comes from completeing levels or completing gaols. you coulf also now with the new update open chest and get orbs to spend on customization. as i stated about the chest thats a big glicth for me in the game. you have two chest and when you open both you get rewards and then have a cool down waiting time untill you could open it again. one problem i have with this is when i open the chest the game freezzes or lags and then gives me a error and skips the reward and goes straight to the time run down. the tester could have do more testing on that aspect.

in closing this game is a good game to kill some time or a game that looks to give a challange. even though this game has some lags and glitches i still like to play this game and keep me into playing it.
