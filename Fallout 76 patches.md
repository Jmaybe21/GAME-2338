the firts bug i saw was the "no access granted error". i believe this is a negative black blox testeing becasue when players try to load up the game or launch it they get a error and cant access the game due to not tyesting to see if the file is currpoted or not. i would have done is set up the game and have someone download it on differtn consoles and then ech console have the player load/launch each game at leats three time to test the start up.

another bug is the weight carry not showing. this test is more of a black blox and comformance testing. the reason i say that is because i believe that players expect to see a weight carry shown on screen to know how much they are carrying and not over carrying. a way to fix this bug is to first have a player a do a quest and then go to their items menu and pull up a weight metter and see if anything produce.

meelee weapons take a couple of swings to srart taking damage on the emeny. this is more of a funtyional black vlox testing because what the players is exprinceing is a delay/lag in the system and when a player goes for a attack instead of a one hit attack they are gettinga 2-4 swing attack. to test this i would have gone to find diffenrt typrs of emenys and attacked them after ive atteaked all the ones i wanted i reload the same area and use a differnt weapon and test the same eneimes.

eniemes regan heath every time they are shot. this bug could have been found in balancing black box testing due to the fact that eneimes cant die even when their hp is down. the game is not balance because the eneimies our bascially inviscible and cant die where the players could take damage and keep the damge until they die. a way to fix this or had tetsted is have a player use differnt typesd of guns on three differnt enimes and afterwards reload the game and do the same test on a diffetrnt sever and software.

power armor reduces points. this could have been found in fuctional white box testing because of the devolpers knowing whats to expect when power armor is on and why points are being deducted. players dont know why and the gane isnt telling them why so i believe the devlopers didnt test to see if the armor did deducted points on purpose and not showing it or is it the armor has a bug in it and is affecting the players. to test this the first thing to do is find differnt types of armor and put each one one and look at each stat before and after the armor is on and see if thiers a change in stats and why.
