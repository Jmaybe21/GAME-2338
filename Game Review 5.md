## Game Review 5

# Details
the game i decided to play is rainbow six seige for the playstations 4. The Game is a online multiplayer,first person shooter.

# Summary
the games is a tactical combat game. its base off sisuation problems for elite specail black ops. you can choose from a verraity of playable charcters for either attaking or defending. once you pick you charcter you then set in a remote location with four other players with you againts five other players and have a objective to complete. defuse the bomb, hostage and a secure a room. the defuse the bomb function of the game is my least favortie due to the fact that you have to you either defuse or protect to bomb rooms while going against the opposiung team. the best fuction of the game is secure the objective. basiclally you just hold down the room or secure with no other back lashes.

# Final thought 
Would i play this game? yes i would. this game keeps my attention and has that feeling like your actually in that sistiation and have a stress plate in you trying to not die whike also trying to kill the opposing threat. however the game also provide a fuction where say you dont feel like playing otherr people and you want a simple game play you could play terriost hunt by yourself or with four of ypour friends.
