## Game Critique
  
  For this game critique i've decided to go with Kingdom Hearts ux for mobile phones. its is a turn based action adventure featured on play store and apple store.
  
  one aspect of the games function is the system that allows players across the world to challenge and battle each other. this function is called PVP or also called player vs player. when testing this function, the use of medals for certain keblades could be handy for most players that have special or favorite medals they could use and not worry about having to keep switching out medals to stay up in ranks. one other function that could be tetsted is the touchscreen movement on different phones. some phones are really high sensetive and sometimes non waterproof. aslo to factor in is the use of stylist on some phones, like how some phones already come with a stylist but other doesn't. as for the the visual and graphic of the games software that could be heavely tetsed and looked at. its a high resolution game which meansn that low ends phones wouldn't be able to produce as well as like a galaxy or a new built iphone. it could also slow down the phones preformace and possible causing hardware and software problems overall.
