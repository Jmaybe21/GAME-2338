## Game Review 2

# Details
the game i played was called marvel's spiderman for ps4

# Summary
the overall aspect of the game is well thought out and played very smoothtly. the basic of the game is to complete missions and expolre the aspect of new york city. you play as the main character peter parker/ spider-man trying to stop crime and protect the citzens of nrw york. however you could also go around looking for landmarks or spideys old backpacks left around. and as you go looking for these items, they could benifit you by uprgading your gadget or suits

# Final thought
